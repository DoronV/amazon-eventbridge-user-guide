# Tutorial: Send a notification when an Amazon S3 object is created<a name="eb-s3-object-created-tutorial"></a>

You can send email notifications when [Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/Welcome.html) objects are created using Amazon EventBridge and [Amazon SNS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html)\. In this tutorial, you will create an SNS topic and subscription\. Then, you will create a [rule](eb-rules.md) in the EventBridge console that sends [events](eb-events.md) to that topic when Amazon S3 `Object Created` events are received\.
