# Events from AWS services<a name="eb-service-event"></a>

Many AWS services generate [events](eb-events.md) that EventBridge receives\. When an AWS service in your account emits an event, it goes to your account’s default event bus\.

 AWS CloudTrail is a service that automatically records events such as AWS API calls\. You can create EventBridge rules that use the information from CloudTrail\. For more information about CloudTrail, see [What is AWS CloudTrail?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html)\.

All events that are delivered by CloudTrail have `AWS API Call via CloudTrail` as the value for `detail-type`\. Events from API actions that start with the keywords `List`, `Get`, or `Describe` aren't processed by EventBridge, with the exception of events from the following AWS STS actions:
+ `GetFederationToken`
+ `GetSessionToken`

To record events with a `detail-type` value of `AWS API Call via CloudTrail`, a CloudTrail trail with logging enabled is required\.

When using CloudTrail with Amazon S3, you need to configure CloudTrail to log data events\. For more information, see [Enabling CloudTrail event logging for S3 buckets and objects ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/enable-cloudtrail-logging-for-s3.html)\.

Some occurrences in AWS services can be reported to EventBridge both by the service itself and by CloudTrail\. For example, an Amazon EC2 API call that starts or stops an instance generates EventBridge events as well as events through CloudTrail\. 

**Important**  
CloudTrail is extending event delivery through EventBridge to resource owners\. Currently, CloudTrail supports both API callers and resource owners to receive events in their S3 buckets by creating trails, and delivers events to API callers through EventBridge\. With this change, resource owners in addition to API callers will be able to monitor cross\-account API calls through EventBridge\. CloudTrail’s integration with EventBridge provides a convenient way to set automated rules\-based workflows in response to events\.  
The CloudTrail team began deploying this update on April 12, 2021 and expect to complete this update in all commercial regions early this month\. As a result, some customers might experience an increase in the EventBridge events being delivered through EventBridge coinciding with this update\. No customer action is required, but should you have any questions, please reach out to AWS Support\. 

You can't use AWS Put\*Events API call events that are larger than 256 KB in size as event patterns because the maximum size of any Put\*Events requests is 256 KB\. For more information about the API calls that you can use, see [CloudTrail supported services and integrations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-aws-service-specific-topics.html)\.

**Note**  
Each AWS service that generates events sends them to EventBridge as either *best effort* or *guaranteed* delivery\.   
*Best effort delivery* means that the service attempts to send all events to EventBridge, but in some rare cases an event might not be delivered\.
*Guaranteed delivery* means the service will successfully attempt to deliver events to EventBridge at least once\.  
EventBridge will accept all valid [events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-events.html) under normal conditions\. In cases where events cannot be delivered because of an EventBridge service disruption, they will be retried again later by the AWS service for up to 24 hours\.
This table includes a representation of the AWS services that send events to EventBridge, but it doesn't include every service\. For services not listed that send events to EventBridge, assume a best effort delivery\.  
Once an event is delivered to EventBridge, EventBridge matches it against [rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-rules.html) and then follows the [retry policy and any dead\-letter queue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-rule-dlq.html) specified for the event target\(s\)\.

The following table shows AWS services that generate events\. Choose the service name to see more information about how that service and EventBridge work together\.
